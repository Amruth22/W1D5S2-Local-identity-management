# Local Identity Management with Security Hardening and Audit Logging - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive Company Meeting Room Booking System that demonstrates advanced local identity management, security hardening practices, and comprehensive audit logging using FastAPI. This project focuses on implementing secure employee authentication, role-based access control, account protection mechanisms, and detailed audit trails for compliance and monitoring in enterprise environments without external dependencies.

## Project Objectives

1. **Local Identity Management:** Master local user identity systems including employee registration, authentication, profile management, and role-based access control without relying on external identity providers.

2. **Security Hardening Implementation:** Implement robust security measures including password complexity policies, account lockout mechanisms, session timeout management, and protection against common authentication attacks.

3. **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Design and implement detailed audit logging systems that track all security events, user activities, and system changes with proper retention policies and compliance features.

4. **Role-Based Access Control:** Build sophisticated permission systems with hierarchical roles (employee, manager, admin) and fine-grained access control for different system resources and administrative functions.

5. **Account Protection Mechanisms:** Implement advanced account security features including failed attempt tracking, automatic account lockout, session management, and secure password policies for enterprise security.

6. **Meeting Room Management:** Create a practical business application demonstrating identity management concepts through a real-world meeting room booking system with conflict prevention and resource management.

## Key Features to Implement

- Local identity management system with employee registration, authentication, and profile management using SQLite database storage
- Security hardening with password complexity requirements (8+ characters, numbers, special characters), account lockout after failed attempts, and session timeout management
- Comprehensive audit logging system tracking all authentication events, profile changes, booking activities, and security incidents with 30-day retention
- Role-based access control with three-tier hierarchy (employee, manager, admin) and permission-based endpoint protection
- Meeting room booking system with conflict prevention, availability checking, and booking history management
- JWT-based authentication with secure token generation, validation, expiration handling, and session management for stateless authentication

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Identity Management Architecture:** Understanding local identity storage, user lifecycle management, and authentication flows without external identity providers
- **Security Hardening Practices:** Implementing password policies, account protection, session management, and defense against brute force attacks
- **Audit Logging Design:** Creating comprehensive audit trails for compliance, security monitoring, and incident investigation with proper data retention
- **Role-Based Authorization:** Designing flexible permission systems that can handle hierarchical roles and fine-grained access control requirements
- **Account Security Mechanisms:** Building robust account protection including lockout policies, session timeout, and secure authentication flows
- **Business Logic Integration:** Seamlessly integrating identity management with real business functionality like meeting room booking and resource management
- **Database Security:** Implementing secure data storage, proper indexing, and protection against common database vulnerabilities

## Expected Outcome

You will create a production-ready local identity management system that demonstrates enterprise-grade security practices and comprehensive audit capabilities. The system will provide secure employee authentication, role-based access control, and detailed audit logging while supporting practical business functionality through a meeting room booking system that can serve as a foundation for enterprise identity management solutions.

## Additional Considerations

- Implement advanced security features including multi-factor authentication (MFA), password history tracking, and advanced account lockout policies
- Add support for detailed audit analytics, security event monitoring, and automated threat detection capabilities
- Create comprehensive compliance reporting for regulatory requirements and security audits
- Implement advanced session management including concurrent session limits and device tracking
- Add support for bulk user management, organizational hierarchy, and department-based access control
- Consider implementing advanced logging features including log encryption, tamper detection, and secure log storage
- Create security monitoring dashboards, alerting systems, and incident response capabilities for enterprise security operations
- Add support for data export, backup procedures, and disaster recovery for business continuity
